# What is AIDR?

AIDR is a platform to collect and classify in real-time a large amount of user-generated messages during humanitarian crises. The platform applies human intelligence (crowdsourcing) and machine intelligence (machine learning) to perform these tasks. This platform is provided as a service via a website, and as free and open source software.
