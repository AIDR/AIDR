AIDR Collector Installation Instructions
----------------------------------------

Required technologies
---------------------
1- Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/)
2- Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org/) OR GlassFish (https://glassfish.java.net/)
3- Redis (http://redis.io/)

Building 
--------
Pre-requisite: Maven should be installed.

AIDR-Collector is a maven based project so it comes with a POM file which the Maven platform uses during the project building process. To build, go to the root directory of the project where POM.xml is also located and run "mvn install" command. This process initiates downloading process of required packages/libraries from the maven central repository. This process may take a few minutes. A successful build will create a target folder in the project root directory and a couple of other files too.  You must find a file "AIDRFetcher-1.0.war" if the building process successfully completed.

Deployment
----------
Pre-requisite: Tomcat/Glassfish server must be installed and running.

Incase of Tomcat:
Simply copy and paste the AIDRFetcher-1.0.WAR file to the <tomcat-root>/webapps directory of the tomcat server. It will automatically deploy the application.

Incase of Glassfish:
Go to the admin page of your Glassfish server, usually it can be accessed through http://localhost:4848/. Login and go to the applications tab, choose deploy option and browse to the "AIDRFetcher-1.0.war" file to deploy it.
