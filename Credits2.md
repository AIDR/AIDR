(In process)

The AIDR project was started in 2013 by [Patrick Meier](http://irevolution.net/) and [Carlos Castillo](http://www.chato.cl/research/) at the [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://www.qcri.qa/) (QCRI).

The initial requirements for AIDR were collected by Patrick Meier in collaboration with Justine Mackinnon and Peter Mosur. Sarah Vieweg contributed user experience ideas and a user study.

The system architecture of AIDR was designed by Carlos Castillo in collaboration with Muhammad Imran, Soudip Chowdhury, and Jakob Rogstadius, during their respective internships at QCRI. It also uses concepts from crowdsourcing stream processing developed with Ioanna Lykourentzou.

The development of AIDR over its first two years was led by Carlos Castillo and Muhammad Imran, with contributions from Ji Lucas, Koushik Sinha, Jakob Rogstadius, and Alex Mikhashchuk.
