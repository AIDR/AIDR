# Objectives

The objective of AIDR (Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response) is to provide a platform to collect and classify in real-time a large amount of user-generated messages during humanitarian crises. The platform applies human intelligence (crowdsourcing) and machine intelligence (machine learning) to perform these tasks. This platform is provided as a service via a website, and as free and open source software.

The main success metrics of AIDR are:

* The number of crises that can be handled simultaneously: AIDR should support tens of crises at the same time.
* The number of messages that can be classified per unit of time: AIDR should support up to hundreds of messages per minute.
* The number of users who can volunteer to help in the classification: AIDR should allow hundreds of volunteers to work simultaneously.

# User Needs

AIDR has two types of users: **operators**, who start and oversee the process of collection and classification, and **labelers**, who are contribute human intelligence through labeled examples.

## User Needs: Operators

Operators of AIDR have the following main needs:

* Maintain (Create, Read, Update or Delete) a set of crisis-related collections
** Create a collection specifying a set of parameters
** Monitor the state of a collection
** Modify the parameters of a collection
** Stop, delete and/or archive a collection
* Maintain (CRUD) for each crisis-related collection, a set of classifiers
** Create a classifier specifying a set of tags for it, or copy an existing (suggested) classifier
** Monitor the classification accuracy
** Modify the tags of the classifier
** Remove the classifier from the collection

Users of AIDR are typically members of emergency-response organizations (including both professional/formal organizations and digital volunteer communities), as well as members of the public.
