# Objectives

The objective of AIDR (Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response) is to provide a platform to collect and classify in real-time a large amount of user-generated messages during humanitarian crises. The platform applies human intelligence (crowdsourcing) and machine intelligence (machine learning) to perform these tasks. This platform is provided as a service via a website, and as free and open source software.

The main success metrics of AIDR are:

* The number of crises that can be handled simultaneously: AIDR should support tens of crises at the same time.
* The number of messages that can be classified per unit of time: AIDR should support up to hundreds of messages per minute.
* The number of users who can volunteer to help in the classification: AIDR should allow hundreds of volunteers to work simultaneously.

# User Needs

AIDR has two types of users: **operators**, who start and oversee the process of collection and classification, and **digital volunteers**, who are contribute human intelligence through labeled examples.
