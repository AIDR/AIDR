There will be two branches: master and dev.

The **master** branch will be the production one, and will run in the production server. If there is any quick fix to apply, it will be applied on the master branch.

The **dev** branch will be the development one, and will be the one against which the developers will work. Developers should commit in the dev branch as long as they don't break the build. Developers can commit before the QA.
